/*
 * This application is an example of how to integrate a simple Ego vehicle into the environment simulator
 * The vehicle is implemented in a separate module (vehicle.cpp)
 * Communication is by means of function calls
 *
 * Ego means that the vehicle is controlled externally, e.g. interactively by a human-in-the-loop
 * or by an AD controller or by an external test framework providing stimuli for a vehicle simulator
 *
 * This application support three types of vehicle controls:
 * 1. Internal: Scenario engine executes according to OpenSCENARIO description (default)
 * 2. External: The vehicle is controlled by the user.
 * 3. Hyybrid: Automatic driver model following a ghost vehicle performing the scenario as i 1.
